# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer using SFML
A CLI sorting algorithm visualizer built from scratch using the SFML C++ graphics library.

## Running
Go into the Build directory to find the SortVisualizer executable and run it without any command line arguments to visualize various sorting algorithms.

## Status
Currently has implementations of bubble and selection sorts. Planning to add insertion, heap and other sorts. Any contribution to implement recursive sorts are welcome.
